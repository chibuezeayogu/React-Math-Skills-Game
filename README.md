# Math Skills Kids' Game -> Play Nine
- Math Skills Kids' Game is a game that allows users to test their arithmetic knowledge of addition. It generates a random number of stars and random numbers between  `0-9`. 
- Users will be allowed to pick/select any random number/numbers between `0-9` that is equal to the number of stars. 
- If the selected number/numbers is/are equal to the number of generated stars, it accepted the answer and marks the numbers as used.
- Once a number has been marked as used, it is disabled and users will not be able to select that number again
- Users have 5 redraws i.e if the number of generated stars, in the available number has been used and no other combination of numbers is not equal to the number of generated stars.
